# ImageIntel with AWS Rekognition

## Project Title
**ImageIntel with AWS Rekognition**

### Tagline
Automated Image Analysis Pipeline using AWS Rekognition, Lambda, and DynamoDB.

## Summary
ImageIntel automatically analyzes images uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket using AWS Rekognitionâ€™s label detection, celebrity recognition, and face detection APIs. The results are then stored in DynamoDB, enabling you to easily track and access insights for each image. This project showcases a seamless, serverless solution for intelligent image processing.

## Key Technologies Used
- **AWS S3**: For easy image storage and triggering automated processes.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless image processing without managing infrastructure.
- **Amazon Rekognition**: For intelligent image analysis, detecting labels, faces, and even celebrities.
- **DynamoDB**: To store results in a fast and scalable database.

## The Architecture
A simple architecture diagram showing how each component works together:

- **AWS S3**: For easy image storage and triggering automated processes.
- **AWS Lambda**: For serverless image processing without managing infrastructure.
- **Amazon Rekognition**: For intelligent image analysis, detecting labels, faces, and even celebrities.
- **DynamoDB**: To store results in a fast and scalable database.

## How It Works
1. **Image Upload**: Users upload an image to an S3 bucket.
2. **Lambda Trigger**: The S3 upload triggers a Lambda function.
3. **Rekognition Analysis**: The Lambda function calls Rekognition to analyze the image for labels, faces, and celebrities.
4. **Results in DynamoDB**: The Lambda function then stores the analysis results in DynamoDB for easy retrieval.
